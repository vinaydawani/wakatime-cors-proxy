# WakaTime CORS proxy

**A proxy server for WakaTime API.**

While trying to access Wakatime API, I was getting errors that Access-Control-Allow-Origin header is not present on the response.

This proxy allows you to bypass those errors by querying this proxy's url. This acts as a middleman and adds appropiate headers.
